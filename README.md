🤖 Arduino Human Following Robot

An autonomous robot that detects and follows a person or object using an ultrasonic sensor for distance measurement and IR sensors for direction detection. Powered by an Arduino Uno and a motor driver shield, it moves forward, turns left/right, or stops based on sensor readings. A servo-mounted ultrasonic sensor scans the surroundings for better tracking.

Features

Human/Object Tracking – Follows a person or an object using ultrasonic distance sensing.

Obstacle Avoidance – Detects objects in its path and adjusts direction accordingly.

Directional Movement – Turns left or right based on IR sensor input.

Servo-mounted Sensor Scanning – Rotates the ultrasonic sensor for wider coverage.

Customizable Motor Speeds – Adjustable via Arduino code for tuning responsiveness.
